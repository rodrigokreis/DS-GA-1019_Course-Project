**Summary:** \
This project aims to use optimization techniques to improve the performance of a logistic regression model. This model predicts whether a customer will default on their credit card payments within 120 days, which is crucial for managing risk in a consumer lending business. By optimizing the code, the project hopes to effectively analyze extensive and complex data to quickly identify future defaults, leading to cost savings for businesses and consumers. The project will utilize techniques such as line profiling, minimizing repetitive for-loops, vectorization through NumPy, Python Jax, and Numba to improve the code's performance. The focus of the project is not on the actual model itself but rather on how well the code can be optimized to process the dataset efficiently.
